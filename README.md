# MTG Card Image Downloader

A GUI-based Python tool that downloads Magic: The Gathering (MTG) card images from a JSON file by reading their `image_uris`. It supports selecting image size and optional image resizing.

---

## ðŸ§  What does this script do?

- Loads a JSON file containing MTG card data.
- Allows the user to choose a target directory to save images.
- Extracts image URLs from the `image_uris` key (or from `card_faces` for double-faced cards).
- Lets the user choose a preferred image size (`small`, `normal`, `large`, `png`, `art_crop`, or `border_crop`).
- Optionally resizes the images to custom dimensions.
- Automatically avoids filename conflicts by appending counters.
- Saves the downloaded images in `.png` or `.jpg` format depending on the original image mode.
